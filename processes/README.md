- **schedule_process(void\* code)**: Schedules a new process.

## spinlock.h / spinlock.c
- **spinlock_t**: Boolean type for spinlocks.
- **spinlock_lock(spinlock_t\* lock)**: Acquires a spinlock.
- **spinlock_unlock(spinlock_t\* lock)**: Releases a spinlock.
- **spinlock_lock_irq_save(spinlock_t\* lock, irqflags_t\* flags)**: Acquires a spinlock and saves interrupt flags.
- **spinlock_unlock_irq_restore(spinlock_t\* lock, irqflags_t\* flags)**: Releases a spinlock and restores interrupt flags.
